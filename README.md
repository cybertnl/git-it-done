In this module, you'll work with Amiko, a fellow web developer whom you met at a local tech meetup. Amiko is eager to contribute to open source projects, but she's found the process of looking for them on GitHub to be time-consuming and tedious. So she's started working on a web app that will search GitHub for open source projects with open issues and pull requests. However, there’s one big blocker: Amiko hasn’t learned JavaScript yet.

And that’s where you come in!
